# Statement

Motion graphics editor turned self-taught software engineer. Recently completed a Harvard certificate course on web programming, capping off my journey as a rounded software engineer with a proven proficiency in Python, Javascript, and C#. My professional as a programmer is limited to creating an online multiplayer game and writing the backend for a shoppify e-commerce site, but my experience entails consuming APIs like Stripe, Google Maps and Twilio, as well as building Django backends and React Frontends.

Recently completed a Harvard certificate course on web programming, capping off my journey as a rounded software engineer with a proven proficiency in Python, Javascript, C#, SQL, Mongo, API consumption, and, more holistically, rapidly acquiring new programming skills as needed. While orchestrating my own programming education is a testament to my drive to learn and my ability to self-direct, I am practiced at organized version management and CI/CD, and am confident that I will thrive in a team, where I can humbly continue to learn.
