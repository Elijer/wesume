# Web Resume

I was getting tired of nudging things around in Photoshop everytime I added something new to my resume, and I realized that CSS is probably a better to do it it. So here we are!

### Parcel.js
At the moment, I am using this for local hosting. You can run `parcel index.html` OR just run `npm test` to run locally.

### SCSS
At the moment, I am using this for hosting. SCSS integrates well with parcel.js, and there doesn't seem to be anything left to worry about it.
